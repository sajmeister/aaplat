# AI Agent Deployment Platform - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building a SaaS platform for deploying and managing AI agents using zero budget and coding agents (Claude via Cursor).

**Status**: Week 3 Complete - Ready for Week 4  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Current Phase**: Railway Integration & Deployment

---

## MVP Strategy (Zero Budget Approach)

### Core Principle
Start with the simplest possible version that demonstrates the core value proposition, then iterate based on user feedback.

### MVP Scope (Phase 1)
**Goal**: Basic agent marketplace + simple deployment to a single cloud provider

**Include**:
- Simple web dashboard (React/Next.js)
- Basic agent registry (file-based initially)
- Single deployment target (start with Vercel/Netlify)
- Simple authentication (Auth0 free tier or NextAuth)
- Basic agent runner (containerized Python/Node.js agents)

**Exclude for MVP**:
- Multi-tenancy
- Billing/subscriptions
- Multiple cloud providers
- Complex orchestration
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)

---

## Recommended Tech Stack (2025 Optimized)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) - Latest stable version
- **Language**: TypeScript (mandatory for maintainability)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (better performance)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui v2 (free, excellent developer experience)
- **State Management**: Zustand (lighter than Redux) + React Query for server state
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier, excellent Next.js integration)

### Backend & API
- **Runtime**: Next.js API routes (Edge runtime where possible)
- **Database**: 
  - Phase 1: Turso (SQLite-based, generous free tier)
  - Alternative: Supabase (PostgreSQL, good free tier)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (lightweight, type-safe)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) with multiple providers
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible, very cheap)
- **Queue System**: Upstash Redis (for background jobs)

### Agent Runtime & Orchestration
- **Container Platform**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: 
  - Phase 1: Railway.app (simpler than Kubernetes)
  - Phase 2: Fly.io (better for global deployment)
  - Future: Nomad (lighter alternative to Kubernetes)
- **Agent Frameworks**: 
  - Python: FastAPI + Pydantic v2
  - Node.js: Hono (faster than Express)
  - Rust: Axum (for performance-critical agents)
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (free)

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Version Control**: GitHub (free)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (free tier sufficient)
- **Monitoring**: 
  - Application: Vercel Analytics + Sentry (error tracking)
  - Infrastructure: Fly.io metrics or Railway monitoring
- **Logging**: Better Stack (formerly Logtail) free tier
- **Domain**: Cloudflare (free DNS management)
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (free tier)

## Current Tasks (Update as needed)

### Next Chat Session Goals (Week 4 - Railway Integration & Deployment):
1. [ ] Set up Railway.app account and CLI integration
2. [ ] Create Docker templates for Python/Node.js agents  
3. [ ] Build deployment interface with real-time status
4. [ ] Implement Railway API integration for deployments
5. [ ] Add deployment logs and health monitoring
6. [ ] Test complete agent deployment workflow

### Current Blockers/Questions:
- Need to decide on agent specification format (JSON schema vs YAML)
- Should we support WebAssembly agents in addition to containers?
- What's the minimum viable agent for initial testing?

### Architecture Decisions to Make:
- Agent runtime isolation level (process vs container vs VM)
- Multi-tenancy strategy (schema-based vs database-based)
- Scaling strategy for agent deployments

### Key Decisions Made (Updated):
- **Next.js 15**: Full-stack development with Edge runtime optimization ✅
- **Turso/SQLite**: Local development with SQLite, production with Turso ✅
- **Railway.app**: Simpler orchestration alternative to Kubernetes - "Just give your container, and go. No clusters, nodes, or YAMLs"
- **TypeScript**: Mandatory for maintainability and coding agent compatibility ✅
- **shadcn/ui v2**: Modern component library with Tailwind CSS v4 ✅
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with SQLite support ✅
- **Modern SaaS patterns**: Following 2025 SaaS development best practices with proper cloud services ✅
